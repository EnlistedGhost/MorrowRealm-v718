# MorrowRealm-v718

Overview:
---------------
MorrowRealm began its life as an overhauled Matrix 718/Rune-Evo-V3 Runescape Private Server based upon the v718 (2012) revision of the game. Additionally to operating on v718 the team is merging in items, features and functionality from the v887 revision to further expand the game. Though this private server is originally based on Runescape (2012) the MorrowRealm project team aims to take the project to a new level by overhauling every aspect section by section including graphics, models, maps, items, and much more. All while retaining what made the 2012 version so much fun.

It is planned to keep an original 2012 feel remake operational side by side with the other realms that are created as of course the team still loves the original game they grew up with and wanted to keep a throwback to it built in still as one of the main focuses and starting area. The decision to eventually replace even the graphics throughout the work on this project is to get away from utilizing any material created by a 3rd party thus truly making the project completely unique/custom.

Please remember, this is a fan made project created by a community that loves what it was in 2012 and wanted to expand it with what they had imagined for it as youths. It is hoped that this repository and the game associated with it bring only joy to all who happen to see, play and/or be a part of it. If someone is interested in being more involved with MorrowRealm in its development or assisting the team with moderating gameplay it is advised that you reach out to us via the contact-us page of the MorrowRealm website.
